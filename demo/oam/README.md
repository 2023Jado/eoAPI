## Case of Study - Open Aeria Map (OAM)

https://map.openaerialmap.org

> OpenAerialMap (OAM) is a set of tools for searching, sharing, and using openly licensed satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery.

Believe it or not but OAM was created more than 9 years ago!!! The design was innovative and the backend was also in advance. It was one of the first application using dynamic tiling (https://github.com/mojodna/marblecutter-openaerialmap) and STAC like metadata (https://github.com/hotosm/oam-api).

Looking at the web page and backend today, it feels still great and better than a lot of similar projects.
